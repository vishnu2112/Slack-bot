## Getting Started
I did this through Node.js. At first we need to install Node.js and get familiarize with it and various modules in it. There is a special documentation for each module in [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/). You should have a slack account and you need to create a bot in it with required options in slack API, then you will get tokens for your bot with which you can access it in your code.
 
You can refer the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps) documention for implementing your bot with required features. At first you need to get familiarize with it.
